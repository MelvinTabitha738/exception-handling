# 🐍 Python Exception Handling

This mini-project explores **exception handling** in Python — how to write error-resistant code that handles unexpected situations gracefully.

## 📌 What I Learned

### ✅ What is Exception Handling?

Exception handling is a way to **catch and respond to errors** that occur during program execution. Instead of crashing, Python lets you handle these issues using `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks.

### 🔧 Syntax

```python
try:
    # Code that might raise an error
except SomeError:
    # Code to handle the error
else:
    # Runs if no exception occurs (optional)
finally:
    # Always runs, no matter what (optional)
